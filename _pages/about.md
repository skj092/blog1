[I](https://docs.google.com/document/d/e/2PACX-1vQDugDtoMXrFYo_cPL6v7zvsvfHr4xi9zMNaWv-YIe2C3JGXKIuq2VH2cXa79HxGd7PpJdJJf2JXWj0/pub) am a mathematics graduate passionate about data science in general deep learning in particular. I love to learn new things and grow. I've spent the last 3 years growing as a developer through experience and education.

I prefer to think of myself as an open-minded, down to earch and outgoing person. I care very much for people who I come across in my life and try to make their lives easier. I love nature as well, this is why I like to go on camping, hiking and all sorts of adventure activities. 

I also like to read about anthropology, psychology and history to know how we all grow and why we are what we are. I am not sure if it's true but I like to think that whatever we do it has a reason most of the time we are not aware of our action and thoughts but it always has the reason.

I am currently working as a Web Developer at Accenture Solution and solve machine learning problems in my free time.
