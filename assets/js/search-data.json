            "content": "About . This notebook is a demonstration of some of capabilities of fastpages with notebooks. . With fastpages you can save your jupyter notebooks into the _notebooks folder at the root of your repository, and they will be automatically be converted to Jekyll compliant blog posts! . Front Matter . The first cell in your Jupyter Notebook or markdown blog post contains front matter. Front matter is metadata that can turn on/off options in your Notebook. It is formatted like this: . # &quot;My Title&quot; &gt; &quot;Awesome summary&quot; - toc:true- branch: master - badges: true - comments: true - author: Hamel Husain &amp; Jeremy Howard - categories: [fastpages, jupyter] . Setting toc: true will automatically generate a table of contents | Setting badges: true will automatically include GitHub and Google Colab links to your notebook. | Setting comments: true will enable commenting on your blog post, powered by utterances. | . The title and description need to be enclosed in double quotes only if they include special characters such as a colon. More details and options for front matter can be viewed on the front matter section of the README. . Markdown Shortcuts . A #hide comment at the top of any code cell will hide both the input and output of that cell in your blog post. . A #hide_input comment at the top of any code cell will only hide the input of that cell. . The comment #hide_input was used to hide the code that produced this. . put a #collapse-hide flag at the top of any cell if you want to hide that cell by default, but give the reader the option to show it: . import pandas as pd import altair as alt . . put a #collapse-show flag at the top of any cell if you want to show that cell by default, but give the reader the option to hide it: . cars = &#39;https://vega.github.io/vega-datasets/data/cars.json&#39; movies = &#39;https://vega.github.io/vega-datasets/data/movies.json&#39; sp500 = &#39;https://vega.github.io/vega-datasets/data/sp500.csv&#39; stocks = &#39;https://vega.github.io/vega-datasets/data/stocks.csv&#39; flights = &#39;https://vega.github.io/vega-datasets/data/flights-5k.json&#39; . . place a #collapse-output flag at the top of any cell if you want to put the output under a collapsable element that is closed by default, but give the reader the option to open it: . print(&#39;The comment #collapse-output was used to collapse the output of this cell by default but you can expand it.&#39;) . The comment #collapse-output was used to collapse the output of this cell by default but you can expand it. . . Interactive Charts With Altair . Charts made with Altair remain interactive. Example charts taken from this repo, specifically this notebook. . Example 1: DropDown . # use specific hard-wired values as the initial selected values selection = alt.selection_single( name=&#39;Select&#39;, fields=[&#39;Major_Genre&#39;, &#39;MPAA_Rating&#39;], init={&#39;Major_Genre&#39;: &#39;Drama&#39;, &#39;MPAA_Rating&#39;: &#39;R&#39;}, bind={&#39;Major_Genre&#39;: alt.binding_select(options=genres), &#39;MPAA_Rating&#39;: alt.binding_radio(options=mpaa)} ) # scatter plot, modify opacity based on selection alt.Chart(df).mark_circle().add_selection( selection ).encode( x=&#39;Rotten_Tomatoes_Rating:Q&#39;, y=&#39;IMDB_Rating:Q&#39;, tooltip=&#39;Title:N&#39;, opacity=alt.condition(selection, alt.value(0.75), alt.value(0.05)) ) . Example 2: Tooltips . alt.Chart(df).mark_circle().add_selection( alt.selection_interval(bind=&#39;scales&#39;, encodings=[&#39;x&#39;]) ).encode( alt.X(&#39;Rotten_Tomatoes_Rating&#39;, type=&#39;quantitative&#39;), alt.Y(&#39;IMDB_Rating&#39;, type=&#39;quantitative&#39;, axis=alt.Axis(minExtent=30)), # y=alt.Y(&#39;IMDB_Rating:Q&#39;, ), # use min extent to stabilize axis title placement tooltip=[&#39;Title:N&#39;, &#39;Release_Date:N&#39;, &#39;IMDB_Rating:Q&#39;, &#39;Rotten_Tomatoes_Rating:Q&#39;] ).properties( width=500, height=400 ) .

            "content": "Example Markdown Post . Basic setup . Jekyll requires blog post files to be named according to the following format: . YEAR-MONTH-DAY-filename.md . Where YEAR is a four-digit number, MONTH and DAY are both two-digit numbers, and filename is whatever file name you choose, to remind yourself what this post is about. .md is the file extension for markdown files. . The first line of the file should start with a single hash character, then a space, then your title. This is how you create a “level 1 heading” in markdown. Then you can create level 2, 3, etc headings as you wish but repeating the hash character, such as you see in the line ## File names above. . Basic formatting . You can use italics, bold, code font text, and create links. Here’s a footnote 1. Here’s a horizontal rule: . . Lists . Here’s a list: . item 1 | item 2 | . And a numbered list: . item 1 | item 2 | Boxes and stuff . This is a quotation . . You can include alert boxes …and… . . You can include info boxes Images . . Code . You can format text and code per usual . General preformatted text: . # Do a thing do_thing() . Python code and output: . # Prints &#39;2&#39; print(1+1) . 2 .

            "title": "Pytorch - Your Favourite Deep Learning Library",
            "content": "Some most common operation using Pytorch . Pytorch is an open source machine learning library probably easiest to start with. It is built by Facebook. In this notebook I will write and discuss five most common and important functions in pytorch. . torch.transpose() | torch.stack() | torch.where() | torch.backward() | torch.add() | . 1. transpose() . In linear algebra, the transpose of a matrix is an operator which flips a matrix over its diagonal, that is it switches the row and column indices of the matrix by producing. Here we will transpose tensor using pytorch transpose function. . . x is a 2-D tensor. we swapped dimension 0 to dimension 1 using torch.transpose() . . we swapped dimension 1 to dimension 0. . . We need to put the dimension which is going to be swapped without. And if we put same dimension twice it has no effect. . Transpose function is very useful while matrix multiplication . 2. stack() . This function conconate every new tensor in new dimension. It add every new tensor to additional dimension . . Here we stacked b over a and created an additional dimesion. . . Here b is the stack of 3 a tensor . To make an stack, all tensors need to be in equal size. . While working with images data, stack function is useful for numerical calculation. . For example- to calculate statistical values like mean, median, etc. Stacking makes easy to calculate all of these. . 3. where() . Returns tensor of element with given condition . . torch.where() returns a tensor with values y if x&gt;0 else it return x. . . here we find the difference between x and y. This function can be used as a loss function in binary classification problems, where the target variable is similar like x and predicted value like y. . . If size of y is less then x then pytorch automatically expand y to the size of x without additional memory. However if the size of y is greater then x, the it doesn’t work. . This function can be used as a loss function in binary classification problems. . 4. backward() . This function is most important function in mathine leanring. It calculate the gradient of a function. . . To calculate gradient we need to set requires_grad = True. . While updating the weight in gradient descent backword function is used to update the weight. . 5. add() . To add two tensor . . Here add function just work like + operator. . . As you can see above the size of y is not the size of x. But pytorch expand the size of y by replacating its data and do elementwise operation. . . Here the size of y is greator then the size of x but x doesn’t expand. Pytorch expand in every dimension, if it increase the dimension of x then it will become 3*3 still doesn’t match the size of y. . It is very helpful while doing tensor operation. Additional operator is one of the most used operator . Conclusion . We have covered five most useful pytorch function. Go the the pytorch documentation and write five function of your choice. .
