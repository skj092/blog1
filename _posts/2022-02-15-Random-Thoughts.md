# A New Beginning

Writing is one of the best habits one can have. I have tried again and again to make it my daily habit. 
Though I used to write in a freeform style whatever comes into my mind. It calms the mind down and I feel
relaxed. But I thought writing publically is not my cup of tea. However, this [article](https://jakobgreenfeld.com/raw) changed my thinking.

You can write freestyle publically too. It feels more natural and easily readable than other styles. Depends
on your goal on what you want to achieve in your writing. Sometimes people want to be highlighted by writing but 
I have a different goal, I want to improve myself by writing and I don't have any aim to be highlighted. 

Trying to get highlighted have a downside, we always focus on what people want to see and we do or try to show 
them off. Instead, we should focus on improving our skills and doing what we like. Being happy, relaxed, and calm 
improve our learning and overall mental health. While chasing a long-term goal you need to be in your natural 
style - calm, relaxed, and happy. 

I am also chasing my long-term goal. Even though I am practicing machine learning for the past 2 years, I still
feel like a beginner. But it happens with everyone, in the journey of gaining the knowledge you spend more time 
in the low confident zone. I must be one the middle of the Dunning-Kruger Curve.

While you feel uncomfortable in the low confident zone, it is also the most beautiful and important zone. It 
teaches us lots of valuable things in life. It teaches us - Discipline and Persistence which is the amazing 
tool you need to achieve anything in life. 

On the journey of being a lifelong learner sometimes I think, "Do I have enough speed ?". However, speed doesn't
matter as long as you keep showing up every day. Showing up every day is the hardest part, you keep getting off 
the track again and again but you also need to learn how to bounce back. It is similar to practicing meditation. 
You keep getting distracted but the important thing is to get back on track. 

Your environment is one of the biggest factors in bouncing back. Our environment has the biggest impact on us.
Therefore we must be aware of our environment. Where and with whom do we spend our time with? How is it helpful 
to achieve what you want? You may not have the kind of environment want but you can always create your own 
environment. In the world of the internet, it is all possible. 

Set your own environment, keep only those people who are helpful to you, Keep bouncing back, Relax and enjoy this journey.
