# My Journey to Corporate

I am a web developer working on one of the big IT companies. On April 30 I'll complete my 3 years of total job experience. In this article, I'll write about my journey so far.

Like most people, it was hard for me to find a job and I was desperate to find any of the jobs I get. One of my friends suggested a job where anyone with a Graduation degree and having basic English knowledge can get selected. And then I applied for an analyst role at that company.

The analyst is a general name given to anyone in a company, and you can't say what is he doing if he says I am an analyst. I used to be a good student in my academics and I was not really happy with what I was doing as my part of the job. Plus the corporate culture where nobody seems real it took me more than 1 year to have a good friend. As anyone can join for the role of what I was working on so nobody got respected too. You don't feel being valued where it is easy to get in. I soon realized that these experiences won't be valuable for other roles in my later career either. 

In my last year of graduation, I met a friend, I have never seen such a smart student in my entire life before. Apart from the knowledge of philosophy, mathematics, economics etc, one thing I really liked about him was the way he treat other people. He made an amazing impact on me and unlocked my vision on lots of bases I had. 

I started reading books and working for the carrier I want, also started to change my vision and look for all the things I had and how to use them effectively to help me get what I want. I soon came to realize my job is not so bad. In fact, it was so easy that I can use all of my energy to learn and improve.
