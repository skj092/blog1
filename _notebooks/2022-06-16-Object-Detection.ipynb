    "YOLO is a family of object detection networks that improved over the years throught the following version; YOLOv1, YOLOv2, YOLOv3 and YOLOv4. The YOLO family of models is a series of end-to-end deep learning models designed for fast object detection, developed by Joseph Redmon, etal. Thought is is no longer the most accurate object detection algorithms, it is a very good choice when you need real-time detection, withoug loss of too much accuracy. "
